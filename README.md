| Enrollment | Open, no prerequisites |
| Assessment | No grades, no credentials |

## Core Text

**Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?** — Philip K. Dick (1968)

## Content Modules

1. **Do Androids Dream?** — Close reading of Dick's novel. Focus: empathy as contested ground.
2. **Turing's Question** — What did Turing actually propose? What did he explicitly not claim?
3. **CAPTCHA: A Brief History of Ritual Humiliation** — From reCAPTCHA to hCaptcha to Cloudflare Turnstile.
4. **Liveness, Presence, and the Interview** — Zoom fatigue, video KYC, and mediated presence.
5. **Who Gets to Decide?** — Power, classification, and the authority to draw lines.

## Dramatic Component

**The Voight-Kampff Prologue**: A brief simulated test experience — not to "pass," but to feel what it's like to be tested. Participants may decline.

## Optional Artifact

A brief reflective piece (500 words or less): *"What would a test for humanity need to detect that no current test can?"*

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
