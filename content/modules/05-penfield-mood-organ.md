# Module 5: The Penfield Mood Organ

## Overview
Affective technology and the engineering of emotional states. If we can dial our feelings, what remains of authentic response?

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Analyze Dick's Penfield Mood Organ as affective technology critique
- [ ] Examine contemporary mood-altering technologies
- [ ] Question the relationship between authenticity and emotion

## Reading Assignment
**Primary Text:** *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*
- Chapters 14-16
- Re-read: Chapter 1 (the Mood Organ scene with Iran)

**Supplementary (Optional):**
- "Affective Computing" - Rosalind Picard (excerpts)
- Articles on social media and emotional manipulation

## Guiding Questions

### On the Mood Organ
1. Why does Iran dial "a self-accusatory depression"?
2. What does it mean that despair can be scheduled?
3. Is a dialed emotion less real than a spontaneous one?

### The Authenticity Problem
1. If empathy can be programmed, what distinguishes human from android?
2. Does the Voight-Kampff test for authentic empathy or any empathy?
3. What is the relationship between mood and moral judgment?

### Contemporary Parallels
1. How do social media platforms engineer emotional states?
2. What is the "mood organ" of the attention economy?
3. When you feel anxious checking your phone, who dialed that setting?

## Discussion Prompts
- "The Mood Organ is the most honest technology in the novel." Defend or refute.
- Iran's choice to feel despair is more human than John's programmed optimism.
- Compare the Mood Organ to: SSRIs, alcohol, meditation apps, doomscrolling.

## Optional Activities
- [ ] Track: Document your emotional states for 3 days. What triggered each?
- [ ] Analysis: Identify 3 technologies that affect your mood. How do they work?
- [ ] Creative: Design your own Mood Organ interface. What settings would you include?

## The Penfield Setting Directory

Dick provides specific dial codes in the novel:
- **382**: "the desire to watch TV, no matter what's on"
- **481**: "awareness of the manifold possibilities of the future"
- **594**: "a self-accusatory depression"
- **888**: "the desire to dial"

### What These Reveal
- Emotions as discrete, addressable states
- The recursive problem of desiring to feel desire
- Depression as a choice rather than affliction
- The possibility of wanting nothing but wanting

## Contemporary Mood Organs

### Algorithmic Feed Curation
Social media platforms optimize for engagement, not wellbeing. The scroll is a dial.

### Pharmaceutical Mood Regulation
SSRIs, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers. We have more precision than the Penfield.

### Gamification and Variable Reward
Slot machine psychology applied to everything. The intermittent reinforcement dial.

### Meditation Apps
Calm, Headspace, etc. Mood organs with better branding.

## The Test of Authentic Emotion
If empathy is what distinguishes human from android, and empathy can be dialed, what does the Voight-Kampff actually measure?
