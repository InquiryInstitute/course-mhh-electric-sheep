# Module 6: The Voight-Kampff Ritual

## Overview
The test as ceremony: what the Voight-Kampff reveals about its administrators. The examiner, examined.

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Analyze the Voight-Kampff as ritual and power dynamic
- [ ] Understand what the test reveals about its creators
- [ ] Prepare for Season 1's technical reconstruction

## Reading Assignment
**Primary Text:** *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*
- Chapters 17-22 (remainder of novel)
- Re-read all Voight-Kampff test scenes

## Guiding Questions

### The Mechanics of the Test
1. What does the Voight-Kampff actually measure? (Not what it claims to measure)
2. Why does the test rely on scenarios about animals?
3. What assumptions does the questionnaire embed?

### The Ritual Elements
1. What is the physical setup of the test? Why does it matter?
2. Who has power during the examination? How does that power shift?
3. What does Rachael's test reveal about the test itself?

### The Examiner's Burden
1. How does administering the test affect Deckard?
2. What happens to the examiner who begins to doubt the test?
3. Is the examiner tested by the test?

## Discussion Prompts
- "The Voight-Kampff is a ritual of exclusion dressed as science." Evaluate.
- Compare the test's authority to that of a medical diagnosis, a criminal verdict, a standardized test score.
- Rachael knows she's an android but believes she isn't. What does this mean for the test?

## Optional Activities
- [ ] Analysis: Map all Voight-Kampff questions in the novel. What themes emerge?
- [ ] Research: Find real empathy tests (Baron-Cohen, etc.). Compare methodology.
- [ ] Creative: Write 5 Voight-Kampff questions for 2026

## Close Reading: The Rachael Test

The pivotal scene where Deckard tests Rachael Rosen is the novel's thesis statement about verification:

1. Rachael answers "correctly" but her responses are learned, not felt
2. The test measures response time, not content
3. Rachael believes her memories are real
4. The Tyrell Corporation has optimized for passing

### What This Reveals
- The test can be studied and beaten
- Implanted memories create genuine emotional responses
- The examiner must believe in the test for it to work
- Corporate interests shape what "human" means

## The Power Dynamics of Testing

### The Examiner's Position
- Sits facing the subject
- Controls the pace and selection of questions
- Interprets the responses
- Decides the outcome

### The Subject's Position
- Must remain still
- Cannot question the questions
- Has no access to their own scores
- Lives or dies by the verdict

This is not a neutral measurement. It is a ritual of power.

## Preparing for Season 1

In Season 1 (Voight-Kampff), you will:
- Reconstruct the test from technical specifications
- Examine existing empathy measurement systems
- Design your own humanity test
- Confront the impossibility of fair detection

The questions you've considered in Season 0 are foundational:
- What is humanity?
- Can it be tested?
- Who benefits from the test?
- What does the test reveal about its creators?
