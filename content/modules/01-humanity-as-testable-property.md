# Module 1: Humanity as a Testable Property

## Overview
What does it mean to claim humanity can be measured, verified, or proven? We begin by examining the assumption that underlies all detection systems.

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the philosophical foundations of "humanity" as a concept
- [ ] Examine historical attempts to define and measure humanity
- [ ] Question the assumptions embedded in verification systems

## Reading Assignment
**Primary Text:** *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* by Philip K. Dick
- Chapters 1-3 (approximately 40 pages)

## Guiding Questions

### Before Reading
1. What makes someone "human" in your view?
2. Can humanity be tested? Should it be?
3. What assumptions do we make when we create verification systems?

### During Reading
1. How does Dick establish the post-war world?
2. What role does the Penfield Mood Organ play in defining "authentic" emotion?
3. How is Mercerism presented as a test of empathy?

### After Reading
1. What does the Voight-Kampff test actually measure?
2. Who designed the test, and what assumptions did they embed?
3. If androids can learn to pass, what does the test really prove?

## Discussion Prompts
- "The test measures empathy, not humanity." Discuss.
- Consider modern verification systems (CAPTCHA, biometrics, behavioral scoring). What do they assume about their subjects?
- Who benefits when humanity becomes a testable property?

## Optional Activities
- [ ] Journal: Write a personal definition of humanity (500 words)
- [ ] Research: Find a modern "humanity test" and analyze its assumptions
- [ ] Creative: Design a test that could never be gamed

## Faculty Dialogue
*Available after completing the reading*
- **a.dick** - Discuss the origins of the empathy theme
- **a.turing** - Explore the Turing Test's relationship to Voight-Kampff
- **a.weizenbaum** - Consider why we build machines that test humanity
