# Module 3: CAPTCHA and Cultural Lag

## Overview
How verification systems encode assumptions about human capability. What happens when machines learn to pass the tests designed to exclude them?

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand how CAPTCHA evolved as a humanity verification system
- [ ] Examine the "arms race" between tests and circumvention
- [ ] Recognize cultural assumptions embedded in verification challenges

## Reading Assignment
**Primary Text:** *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*
- Chapters 8-10

**Supplementary (Optional):**
- "CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security" - von Ahn et al.
- Any recent article on AI solving CAPTCHAs

## Guiding Questions

### On Verification Technology
1. What assumptions does CAPTCHA make about human capability?
2. Why did "identify the traffic lights" become a humanity test?
3. What happens when the test becomes the training data?

### Literary Connections
1. How does Dick's world verify humanity without digital systems?
2. What role does the Penfield Mood Organ play in authentic response?
3. When Deckard questions his own humanity, what test could resolve it?

### The Arms Race
1. If machines can pass any test we design, what does that mean?
2. Is there a test that cannot be learned or gamed?
3. Who benefits from increasingly sophisticated verification?

## Discussion Prompts
- "CAPTCHA is a Voight-Kampff for the internet." Evaluate this analogy.
- Consider a website you use regularly. What implicit tests does it run on you?
- If an AI passes every CAPTCHA, should it be allowed to create accounts?

## Optional Activities
- [ ] Research: Document 5 different types of CAPTCHA and their assumptions
- [ ] Analysis: When did AI first reliably solve text CAPTCHAs? Image CAPTCHAs?
- [ ] Creative: Design a CAPTCHA that tests something other than pattern recognition

## Historical Context

### The Evolution of CAPTCHA
- **2000**: Luis von Ahn coins "CAPTCHA"
- **2003**: Distorted text becomes standard
- **2007**: reCAPTCHA introduces dual-purpose transcription
- **2014**: "No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA" (checkbox)
- **2017**: Invisible reCAPTCHA (behavioral analysis)
- **2019+**: AI consistently outperforms humans on visual CAPTCHAs

### The Cultural Lag Problem
Technology changes faster than our tests can adapt. By the time we deploy a new verification system, the conditions that made it effective have often already changed.
