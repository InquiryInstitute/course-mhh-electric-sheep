# Module 4: Behavioral Scoring

## Overview
From credit scores to social credit: when behavior becomes data. The quiet transformation of judgment into algorithm.

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Trace the development of behavioral scoring systems
- [ ] Understand how algorithms encode and perpetuate assumptions
- [ ] Examine the relationship between surveillance and verification

## Reading Assignment
**Primary Text:** *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*
- Chapters 11-13

**Supplementary (Optional):**
- "Weapons of Math Destruction" excerpts - Cathy O'Neil
- Articles on China's Social Credit System

## Guiding Questions

### On Scoring Systems
1. What behaviors does a credit score actually measure?
2. Who designed these metrics? What did they optimize for?
3. How does a score become a self-fulfilling prophecy?

### Literary Analysis
1. How does Dick's society track and evaluate citizens?
2. What is the relationship between owning animals and social standing?
3. How does the bounty system create behavioral incentives?

### Power and Surveillance
1. Who has access to behavioral data? Who profits from it?
2. What recourse do individuals have when scores are wrong?
3. How does constant monitoring change behavior itself?

## Discussion Prompts
- "A credit score is a test of worthiness, not creditworthiness." Discuss.
- Compare Mercerism's collective empathy to modern social media engagement metrics.
- If behavior is data, what does it mean to have an "authentic" action?

## Optional Activities
- [ ] Research: Obtain and analyze your own credit report
- [ ] Analysis: Map the data points that comprise a credit score
- [ ] Creative: Design a "social score" that measures something you value

## Case Studies

### FICO Score (1989-present)
- Originally designed for consumer lending
- Now used for: insurance, employment, housing, dating
- Feedback loops: Bad score → worse conditions → worse behavior → worse score

### Social Credit (China, 2014-present)
- Explicit behavioral modification through scoring
- Rewards and punishments for citizens and businesses
- Integration of surveillance and verification

### Insurance Telematics
- Driving behavior monitored for premium adjustment
- What is "safe" driving? Who defines it?
- The car as informant

## The Fundamental Question
When behavior becomes data, and data becomes judgment, who is the examiner? 

In Dick's world, the Voight-Kampff examiner is visible, accountable, human. In our world, the examiner is algorithmic, distributed, invisible.
