# Welcome to Electric Sheep (Season 0)

## What This Season Is

Electric Sheep is an **always-open preparatory threshold** — not a cohort, not a course with deadlines, but a contemplative space where you read, reflect, and prepare for deeper inquiry.

This is Season 0: the foundation for everything that follows.

## What You'll Do

1. **Read** Philip K. Dick's *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*
2. **Reflect** on guided questions about humanity, empathy, and testing
3. **Engage** (optionally) with faculty dialogues and peer discussion
4. **Prepare** for the technical and philosophical work of Seasons 1 and 2

## How This Works

- **Self-paced**: There are no deadlines. Take the time you need.
- **No exams**: There is nothing to pass or fail.
- **Optional participation**: Discussion and dialogue are available but not required.
- **Preparatory**: This season establishes concepts you'll build on later.

## The Core Text

You will need a copy of:

> **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?**  
> by Philip K. Dick (1968)
>
> Available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook formats.

We recommend reading the full novel, though the modules focus on specific chapters.

## Module Structure

Each module includes:
- **Overview**: What we're exploring and why
- **Reading Assignment**: Specific chapters to read
- **Guiding Questions**: Before, during, and after reading
- **Discussion Prompts**: For reflection and conversation
- **Optional Activities**: Deeper engagement opportunities
- **Faculty Dialogue**: AI-facilitated conversations with course faculty

## Your Journey

## Begin When Ready

There is no "start" button. Begin with Module 01 when you have your copy of the book.

Take your time. The questions we're asking have no easy answers.
