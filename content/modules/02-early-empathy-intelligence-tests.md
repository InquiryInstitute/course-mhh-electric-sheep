# Module 2: Early Empathy and Intelligence Tests

## Overview
The history of testing: IQ tests, empathy measures, and their institutional uses. Who designed these tests, and what did they assume about intelligence and emotion?

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Trace the historical development of intelligence testing
- [ ] Understand the institutional contexts that shaped test design
- [ ] Recognize how tests encode cultural and political assumptions

## Reading Assignment
**Primary Text:** *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*
- Chapters 4-7

**Supplementary (Optional):**
- Selections from Weizenbaum's *Computer Power and Human Reason* (Chapter 1)

## Guiding Questions

### Historical Context
1. Why were intelligence tests created? Who funded them?
2. What populations were early tests designed to sort?
3. How did institutional needs shape test design?

### Literary Analysis
1. How does Dick portray the administrators of the Voight-Kampff test?
2. What authority do the testers possess?
3. How do the tested (human and android) respond to examination?

### Contemporary Connections
1. What modern institutions use testing to sort populations?
2. How do standardized tests encode assumptions about capability?
3. Who profits from the testing industry?

## Discussion Prompts
- "A test reveals more about its creators than its subjects." Evaluate this claim.
- Compare the Voight-Kampff to modern psychological assessments.
- Consider the power dynamics inherent in any testing situation.

## Optional Activities
- [ ] Research: History of one major standardized test (IQ, SAT, MBTI, etc.)
- [ ] Analysis: Who designed it? For what purpose? What changed?
- [ ] Reflection: Have you ever felt a test measured the wrong things?
