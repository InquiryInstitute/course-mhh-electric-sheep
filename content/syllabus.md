## Module Sequence

### Module 00: Welcome
*Time: 30 minutes*

**Activity:** Read welcome materials, set up your reading space.

---

**Supplementary:** Brief history of intelligence testing (provided)  
**Reflection:** What assumptions do tests embed?

---

### Module 03: CAPTCHA and Cultural Lag

The daily ritual of proving you're human. What does it mean that we've normalized this?

---

### Module 04: Behavioral Scoring

---

### Module 06: The Voight-Kampff Ritual
*Time: 2 hours*

The test at the heart of the novel. What does it actually measure?

**Optional Experience:** The Voight-Kampff Prologue (simulated test)  
**Reflection:** What would a fair test for humanity look like?

---

## The Voight-Kampff Prologue

An optional dramatic experience where you undergo a simulated Voight-Kampff test. This is not a game or a quiz — it is a ritual inoculation.

**Format:** Interactive dialogue (text-based)  
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Participation:** Voluntary — you may decline without consequence

The prologue is designed to help you *feel* what it's like to be tested, not to evaluate you.

---

## Optional Artifact

At the end of Season 0, you may submit a brief reflective piece:

**Prompt:**  
*"What would a test for humanity need to detect that no current test can?"*

**Format:** 500 words or less, written  
**Submission:** Email to hello@inquiry.institute with subject "S0 Artifact"  
**Deadline:** None (anytime before May 2026)

**What happens to it:**
- Outstanding artifacts may be invited for discussion in Season 1
- Submission is not required for S1 enrollment
- No feedback is guaranteed (we read them all, we can't respond to all)

---

## Completion

There is no formal "completion" for Season 0. You have completed it when:

1. You have read *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*
2. You have engaged with the modules (reading, reflection)
3. You have decided whether to continue to Season 1

**No certificate. No badge. No proof.**

If you need external validation of completion, this arc may not be for you — and that's okay.

---

## Preparing for Season 1

If you decide to continue:

### Check Prerequisites
- Basic programming ability (Python or JavaScript)
- Comfort with philosophical ambiguity

## A Note on Pace

Some of you will finish in a weekend. Some will take months. Both are valid.

The point is not to finish. The point is to let the questions work on you.

Dick wrote this novel in a world without AI, without social media, without algorithmic recommendation. He saw something we're only now beginning to understand.

Take your time. The sheep will wait.
