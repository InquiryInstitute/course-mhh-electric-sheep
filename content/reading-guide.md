# Reading Guide: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

*Philip K. Dick, 1968*

---

## How to Read This Book

Philip K. Dick wrote fast, cheap, and weird. His prose can feel rushed. His plots can seem arbitrary. His characters can behave inconsistently.

This is not a flaw. It's a feature.

Dick wasn't writing for literary prizes. He was excavating questions from his own troubled psyche and packaging them as pulp science fiction. The roughness is the point — these ideas came out too fast to polish.

Read for the questions, not the craft.

## About Philip K. Dick

**Born:** December 16, 1928, Chicago  
**Died:** March 2, 1982, Santa Ana, California

### Essential Context

- Twin sister Jane died six weeks after birth. Dick was haunted by her absence his entire life. The theme of *doubles* — authentic vs. simulated, real vs. copy — is deeply personal.

- Struggled with mental illness, drug use, and poverty for most of his career. Wrote 44 novels, mostly for small advances.

- Received almost no literary recognition in his lifetime. Now considered one of the most important American writers of the 20th century.

- *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* was written in 1966, sold for $1,500, and largely ignored until *Blade Runner* (1982) — the year Dick died.

### Why This Matters

Dick wasn't speculating about robots. He was asking: *What if the thing that makes us human — empathy — could be faked?* And underneath that: *What if I'm the fake?*

The androids aren't the villains. They're mirrors.

## Before the Novel: 1966

When Dick wrote this book:
- No personal computers
- No internet
- No AI (as we understand it)
- Vietnam War escalating
- Civil rights movement in turmoil
- Nuclear annihilation felt imminent

The "World War Terminus" in the novel isn't allegory. It was extrapolation from lived dread.

## The World of the Novel

### Post-War Earth
- Nuclear/chemical war has devastated the planet
- Most animals are extinct
- Radiation ("dust") slowly poisons those who remain
- Emigration to Mars is encouraged/coerced
- Androids serve as labor incentive for emigrants

### Key Technologies

**Penfield Mood Organ:** Device that dials emotions. Users can schedule their feelings. Iran dials "desire to watch TV" followed by "satisfaction at having watched." Rick uses it to dial "creative, enterprising attitude."

*Question: If you can choose your emotions, are they still yours?*

**Empathy Box / Mercerism:** VR religion where users grip handles and merge with Wilbur Mercer, who endlessly climbs a hill while being pelted with rocks. Users feel each other's emotions.

*Question: Is shared suffering real connection, or collective hallucination?*

**Voight-Kampff Test:** Measures empathic response to morally troubling scenarios. Used to identify androids, who lack genuine empathy.

*Question: What does empathy actually look like? Can it be performed?*

**Electric Animals:** Status symbols. Real animals are rare and expensive. Most people have electric replicas. The shame of owning a fake is intense.

*Question: Why do we need external markers of authenticity?*

## Chapter-by-Chapter Guide

### Chapters 1-3: The Setup

**Rick Deckard** wakes, argues with his wife Iran about mood dialing, and encounters his electric sheep (disguised as real for the neighbors). He learns that the top bounty hunter, Dave Holden, has been injured — six Nexus-6 androids have escaped from Mars.

**Key passages:**
- Iran dialing "despair" to feel something real (p. 3-4)
- Rick's shame about the electric sheep (p. 7-9)
- The bounty briefing (p. 20-24)

**Reflection:** Why does Rick feel shame about a "fake" sheep? What makes a real one better?

---

### Chapters 4-6: The Test

Rick visits the **Rosen Association** to calibrate the Voight-Kampff against their newest androids. He tests **Rachael Rosen**, who seems human but fails the test. Then she passes — but then...

**Key passages:**
- The Voight-Kampff procedure described (p. 40-46)
- Rachael's test results and Rick's confusion (p. 48-52)

**Reflection:** The test measures *response latency* to moral scenarios. What assumptions does this embed? Can empathy be timed?

---

### Chapters 7-9: The First Retirement

Rick "retires" (kills) **Polokov**, an android disguised as a Soviet cop. He then tracks down **Luba Luft**, an android opera singer. But she is arrestingly human — cultured, artistic, moving.

**Key passages:**
- Polokov fight (p. 80-86)
- Luba Luft at the opera (p. 88-95)

**Reflection:** Luba is an android who appreciates Munch's paintings. Rick is a human who kills for money. Who is more "human"?

---

### Chapters 10-12: The Parallel Bounty Hunter

**Phil Resch** appears — another bounty hunter from a parallel police station. He and Rick track Luba together. Resch shoots her with disturbing coldness. Rick begins to doubt — is Resch an android? Is he?

**Key passages:**
- Rick testing Resch (p. 120-125)
- Resch's indifference to killing (p. 130-132)

**Reflection:** Resch passes the Voight-Kampff but seems less empathic than some androids. What does the test actually measure?

---

### Chapters 13-15: J.R. Isidore

**J.R. Isidore** is a "chickenhead" — someone whose intelligence has been damaged by radiation. He lives alone in an abandoned building. Three escaped androids move in: **Pris**, **Roy**, and **Irmgard**. Isidore befriends them, especially Pris.

**Key passages:**
- Isidore's loneliness (p. 140-145)
- Pris cutting the legs off a spider (p. 180-184)

**Reflection:** Isidore, a damaged human, shows more kindness to the androids than they show to him. What does this suggest about the empathy hierarchy?

---

### Chapters 16-18: Mercerism Exposed

**Buster Friendly**, a TV host, reveals that Wilbur Mercer is a fraud — an actor, Al Jarry, who filmed the ascent years ago. Mercerism is a hoax.

But Mercer appears to Isidore anyway.

**Key passages:**
- The exposé (p. 185-190)
- Mercer's response: "It doesn't matter if I'm fake" (p. 195-197)

**Reflection:** If Mercer is fake but the *experience* of merging is real, does authenticity matter? Is this different from the androids?

---

### Chapters 19-21: The Final Retirements

Rick confronts and retires Roy, Irmgard, and Pris. But something has changed. He experiences a Mercer-like vision in the desert, finds a toad (apparently real), and returns home.

**Key passages:**
- Roy Baty's death (p. 205-210)
- The toad revelation (p. 220-224)

**Reflection:** The toad is electric. Rick keeps it anyway. What has he learned?

---

## Key Themes

### Empathy as Currency
In this world, empathy isn't just a feeling — it's the legal definition of humanity. If you can't feel what others feel, you can be killed.

*But:* Isidore has empathy and is treated as subhuman. Resch lacks empathy and is legally human. The system doesn't measure what it claims to.

### Authenticity and Simulation
Electric animals, Mercer's fraud, Rachael's implanted memories — everything in this world might be fake. The question isn't *is it real?* but *does the difference matter?*

### Kipple
Dick's term for the entropy of abandoned spaces. Kipple multiplies, entropy wins, decay is inevitable. The universe tends toward disorder. Humans fight kipple; androids don't care.

### The Double
Rachael/Pris share the same model. Roy and Rick mirror each other. The android is the human's double — what we fear we might be.

## Discussion Questions

### On Empathy
1. Is empathy innate or learned?
2. Can empathy be measured without cultural bias?
3. If an android perfectly simulates empathy, is it real?

### On Testing
1. Who designed the Voight-Kampff? What assumptions did they embed?
2. What happens when the tested become aware of what's being tested?
3. Is there any test that couldn't be gamed with enough information?

### On Authenticity
1. Iran dials her emotions. Are they less real than "natural" feelings?
2. Mercer is fake but Mercerism works. What does this mean?
3. Why does Rick keep the electric toad?

### On This Course
1. How is CAPTCHA like the Voight-Kampff?
2. What modern tests assume "humanity" can be measured?
3. Who decides who gets to be human?

## Differences from Blade Runner

| Novel | Film (1982) |
|-------|-------------|
| Mercerism central | Mercerism absent |
| Electric animals throughout | One fake owl |
| Iran (wife) present | No wife |
| J.R. Isidore is a chickenhead | J.F. Sebastian is a toymaker |
| Androids live 4 years | Same |
| Ambiguity about Deckard | Enhanced ambiguity |
| Setting: San Francisco | Setting: Los Angeles |

The film is brilliant, but it's not the book. Read the book first, then watch the film to see what Ridley Scott kept, cut, and changed.

## A Final Thought

Dick once said: "The authentic human being is one of us who instinctively knows what he should not do, and, in addition, he will balk at doing it."

The androids in this book can learn what they should not do. They just don't *balk*.

Neither, sometimes, do we.

That's the question Dick leaves us with.
